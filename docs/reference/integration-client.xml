  <title>Integrating with cloud providers</title>
  <para>
    Integration with cloud providers can be achieved by fetching a list of exported
    cloud provider accounts using cloud_providers_get_providers(). This function returns
    a list of #CloudProviderAccount objects that can then be used to obtain details about
    the accounts.
  </para>
  <para>
    To get notified about changes of individual accounts, the #CloudProviderAccount::changed
    signal is being emitted everytime information about an account changes. Any UI elements
    should be updated after receiving this signal.
  </para>
  <para>
    Besides the account details, cloud providers may also export a #GMenuModel and a #GActionGroup
    to provide actions that are related with the account. Those can be obtained by calling
    cloud_provider_account_get_menu_model() and cloud_provider_account_get_action_group()
  </para>
